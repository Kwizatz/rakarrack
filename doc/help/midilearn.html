<h2>MIDI Learn</h2>

<h2><img alt="MIDI Learn window" src="imagenes/midilearn.jpg"></h2>

<p>This is the MIDI Learn window, that brings the possibility to create
a MIDI implementation table for each preset in the bank. You can see
two browsers, one at the left with all the available effect parameters,
and another at the right with all the presets in the Bank.</p>

<p> You can open this window clicking the rigth mouse over a effect
parameter that can be controllable by MIDI. Also you can auto assign the
incoming MIDI Control message "automagically" if you enbale on the
settings.</p>

<p>The radio buttons "All" and "Current" select the parameters listed in the
browser, "Current" display only the actual preset parameters availables in
MIDI learn.</p>

<p>The most important thing here is the input box located below the
parameter browser, here you can select the number of the MIDI Control
Message, you can edit by hand, or selecting and dragging, or capturing
an incoming MIDI message clicking on the Get MIDI Message button. When
you have the desired control number you need to assign to the effect
parameters, clicking on the button assign, this message will be engaged
to the selected effect parameter on the browser.</p>

<p>You can "Assign" up to 20 effects parameter for a single
control number message, also you can use different control
messages to manage only one effect parameter.</p>
<p>The "Assign to All" <b>add</b> this
single assignment to all the presets in the bank, preserving
everything that you have previously assigned in all the presets,
contrary to what is doing in the "Copy to All" button that overwrite
all the assignments.</p>


<p>The grid boxes in the middle display the engaged MIDI
control messages to the selected effect parameter on the browser, the
Assignment for a single effect parameter can be cleared with the
button "Clear Assignments", also you can clear all the assignments
for this preset with the button Clear Preset".</p>

<p>In the left part of the window you have the list of presets in the
working bank, you can copy from or to the selected preset, that copy
all the preset table of a single preset.</p>
<p>The "Copy to All" button copy the actual preset to all the presets in the Bank.</p>


<p>The midi learn implementation tables is saved on the preset file
for a single preset, and in a separate file in the case of the Banks,
the program read this bank preset file when read the normal bank file.</p>
