This app was born after an informal conversation about effects for guitar using GNU/linux.
The major part of this apps are discontinued or simply not have new versions after few
years. Josep Andreu say on the IRC chat "I can made an app based on the effects set 
hiden on code of ZynAddSubFX (by Paul Nasca Octavian). Some time after here is the
result of our work... 

This app has 42 effects: EQ Lineal, Compressor, Distortion, Overdrive, Echo, Chorus,
Phaser, Flanger, Reverb , Parametric EQ, Wah Wah, Alienwha, Harmonizer etc. 
The effects are procesed in cascade... The order of effects are configurable by the user. 
The state of rack can be saved as 'presets'. Sets of presets can be stored as 'banks'. 
The rack also has an integrated tuner and can receive MIDI control orders and can send MIDI 
notes to MIDI devices like synthesizers.

rakarrack is a JACK app.

The dependencies are:

libfltk1.1
libxpm
libjack100.0
libasound2
libsamplerate0
libsndfile1
aconnect  (part of Debian Package alsa-utils, name may vary on other distributions)
jackd
libxft2

If you want to compile you will also need the development packages:

libxpm-dev 
libfltk1.1-dev
libjack-dev
libsndfile1-dev
libsamplerate0-dev
libasound2-dev
libxft-dev

The name of the packages are typical of the naming convention for Debian-based distributions.
These can be a little different for each distro. Use your package manager search function
to find the equivalent package for your distribution.

If you are new to building packages from source code on Linux you will need a few other things
to set up a minimal development environment.
1) g++ (the compiler)
2) make
3) autotools-dev

Then if compiling from git repository, you need these too.
1) git-core (it is probable you have this if you're reading this README as it is likely you already used it to git the code).
2) autogen

If working from a graphical environment, you may wish to install 
qjackctl or patchage to aid with configuring jackd and connecting JACK clients.
