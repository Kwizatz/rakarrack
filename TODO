Things to do before 0.7.0

-New Effects
-Echotron window to edit files.
-Repository
-Waveshaper  2.0 * sin(PERIOD/(i+1)) * sin(PERIOD/(i+1)) * sample * sample 

DSP TODO:

- Smooth limiting in Expander
- Fix Synthfilter level adjustment with HPF & LPF stages
- Improve Tuner
*This is a wish-list.  To be started after release of 0.5.8.
- Improve sub-octave modulator for distortion.  Perhaps this can be a new effect.
- Dynamic echo:  Delay time changes with input signal dynamics....possible to get a "bouncing ball" effect.
- Ring modulator + arpeggiated carrier.
- Infinite series:  i.e. Barberpole phaser, flanger and maybe some unique comb filter types.
- Seqtron
- 4 voice Harmonizer
- Acoustic Simulator

Plugin List:
Tim Goetze CAPS Plugins
- AmpVTS tube amp with tone stack circuit -- probably best to add to StompBox
- Scape -- Fractal modulated stereo delay...Maybe we could add the fractal modulation to existing delay effect if easier...
